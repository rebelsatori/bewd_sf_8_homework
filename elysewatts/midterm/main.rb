require 'some gem that will be useful'

require_relative 'lib/some file that i will need'


### Requirements ###
# Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).
# Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
# Must be object oriented. You must instantiate classes. The only file that can run without classes is your main.rb
