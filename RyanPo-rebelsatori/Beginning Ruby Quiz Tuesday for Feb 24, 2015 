3. What is a Git Repository?

Answer :
It's where you store your work history, a repository has branches which has forks within a repository.

Within a repository you have branches, which are effectively forks within your own repository. Your branches will have an ancestor commit in your repository, and will diverge from that commit with your changes. You can later merge your branch changes. Branches let you work on multiple disparate features at once.

You can also track individual branches in remote repositories. This allows you to pull in changes from another individual's branches and to merge them into a branch of your own. This may be useful if you and a friend are working on a new feature together.
