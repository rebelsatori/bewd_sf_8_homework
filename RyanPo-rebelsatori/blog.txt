What I learned during my first class, and this is the class after installation day

I learned that Back End Web Development involves a lot of the heavy work. 
You’re like the architect, electrician, plumber, carpenter, foreman, and the 
crane driver and so on. 

Learning never ends, it’s complex and it never stops being challenging.
There’s never a shortage of work to do. 

Problem solving skills
1. Stop
2. What problem am I trying to do?
3. What assumptions am I making?
4. How can I solve it?
5. Ask instructors/peer or hit up Stack Overflow
6. Once you understand you can write code

I learned git init

Version Control

Github

I learned Bash and Git Commands



I also learned that Back End Web Developers can do the work of Front End, but usu. 
they just do the placeholders that the Front End Web Developers will later work on
