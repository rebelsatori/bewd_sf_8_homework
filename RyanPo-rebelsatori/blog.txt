I learned that Back End Web Development involves a lot of the heavy work. 
You’re like the architect, electrician, plumber, carpenter, foreman, and the 
crane driver and so on. 

I also learned that Back End Web Developers can do the work of Front End, but usu. 
they just do the placeholders that the Front End Web Developers will later work on

Learning never ends, it’s complex and it never stops being challenging.
There’s never a shortage of work to do. 

Problem solving skills
1. Stop
2. What problem am I trying to do?
3. What assumptions am I making?
4. How can I solve it?
5. Ask instructors/peer or hit up Stack Overflow
6. Once you understand you can write code

How does Git work?
