Back-End Web Development

##MIDTERM  REQUIREMENTS

Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

-  Create a directory in your personal homework folder called "midterm" and put all files there.
-  Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).
-	Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
-	Must be object oriented. You must instantiate classes. The only file that can run without classes is your main.rb (look at past homework for how this works; remember to use `require_relative`).
-	Push code on Github.


##GRADING
Your midterm is considered completed if it meets all requirements above. Your instructor and T.A will provide you with feedback!
