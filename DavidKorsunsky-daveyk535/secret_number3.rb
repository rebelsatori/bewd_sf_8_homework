#Improvements:
#Capitalize first name and last name
#Validate name is only letters
#Validate guess is only numbers and is less than 10

#Secret number game developer by Dave Korsunsky

#Basic intro to the game

puts "Hi " + name + '!'
puts "You have three attempts to guess the secret number between 1 and 10."

#Game logic
secret = 5
